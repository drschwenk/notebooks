      "• The cell membrane consists of two layers of phospholipids. Transport proteins are embedded in the layers.\n",
      "The movement of substances across the cell membrane may be by passive or active transport.\n",
      "• Passive transport requires no energy because it moves substances by diffusion, from an area of higher to lower\n",
      "concentration. This happen by simple diffusion or by facilitated diffusion, which requires the help of transport\n",
      "proteins.\n",
      "• Active transport requires energy because it moves substances from an area of lower to higher concentration.\n",
      "An example is the sodium-potassium pump. Another form of active transport is vesicle transport, which is\n",
      "needed for very large molecules.\n",

      "Glucose is a substance that passes across cell membranes by facilitated diffusion. All cells need glucose for energy.\n",

      "2. What process produces glucose?\n",

      "Passive Transport\n",
      "Passive transport occurs when a substance passes through the cell membrane without needing any energy to pass\n",
      "through. This happens when a substance moves from an area where it is more concentrated to an area where it is less\n",
      "concentrated. Concentration is the number of particles of a substance in a given volume. Let’s say you dissolve\n",
      "a teaspoon of salt in a cup of water. Then you dissolve two teaspoons of salt in another cup of water. The second\n",
      "solution will have a higher concentration of salt.\n",
      "Why does passive transport require no energy? A substance naturally moves from an area of higher to lower\n",
      "concentration. This is known as moving down the concentration gradient. The process is called diffusion. It’s\n",
      "a little like a ball rolling down a hill. The ball naturally rolls from a higher to lower position without any added\n",
      "energy. You can see diffusion if you place a few drops of food coloring in a pan of water. Even without shaking\n",
      "or stirring, the food coloring gradually spreads throughout the water in the pan. Some substances can also diffuse\n",
      "through a cell membrane. This can occur in two ways: simple diffusion or facilitated diffusion.\n",

      "Introduction\n",
      "The cell is the site of all of the basic biochemical processes that keep organisms alive. To do its work, the cell needs\n",
      "substances such as oxygen, water, and glucose. The cell also must get rid of substances, including wastes such as\n",
      "carbon dioxide. In addition, harmful substances must be kept out of the cell. Controlling what enters or leaves a cell\n",
      "is an important role of the cell membrane.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Active Transport\n",
      "Active transport occurs when a substance passes through the cell membrane with the help of extra energy. This\n",
      "happens when a substance moves from an area where it is less concentrated to an area where it is more concentrated.\n",
      "This is the opposite of diffusion. The substance moves up, instead of down, the concentration gradient. Like\n",
      "rolling a ball uphill, this requires an input of energy. The energy comes from the molecule named ATP (adenosine\n",
      "triphosphate). The energy allows special transport proteins called pumps to move substances to areas of higher\n",
      "concentration. An example is the sodium-potassium pump.\n",

      "need help to pass through the membrane. The help is provided by proteins called transport proteins. This process\n",
      "is known as facilitated diffusion.\n",
      "There are two types of transport proteins: channel proteins and carrier proteins. They work in different ways. You\n",
      "can see how they work in Figure 4.3.\n",
      "• A channel protein forms a tiny hole called a pore in the cell membrane. This allows water or hydrophilic\n",
      "molecules to bypass the hydrophobic interior of the membrane.\n",
      "• A carrier protein binds with a diffusing molecule. This causes the carrier protein to change shape. As it does,\n",
      "it carries the molecule across the membrane. This allows large molecules to pass through the cell membrane.\n",

      "You can see a model of the cell membrane in Figure below. The molecules that make up the cell membrane\n",
      "are mainly phospholipids. There are two layers of phospholipids. They are arranged so the lipid tails are on the\n",
